"""
Compatibility shim for the deprecated stdlib module ``imghdr``.

Python 3.13 removed :mod:`imghdr`, but some third‑party libraries (e.g.
PaddleOCR 2.x) still import it. In this codebase those libraries only
need the module to exist; they do not rely on its functionality.

We therefore provide a minimal stub that satisfies ``import imghdr`` and
exposes a ``what`` function with the same signature. It always returns
``None``, which is sufficient for our current usage.
